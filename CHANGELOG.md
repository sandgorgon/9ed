# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Project scaffolding: `go.mod`, dependency pins, CI, license.
- `deck` package: `Card`/`Segmenter`, plus `MarkdownSegmenter` and `GoSegmenter`
  (`go/parser`/`go/ast`), each covering `[0, len(src))` exactly.
- `cmd/9ed`: Nav-mode shell — read-only, navigable card list for a `.go`/`.md`
  file, via `tui`'s `widget.List`.
- `cmd/9ed`: Edit mode — Enter focuses the current card in `widget.TextArea`,
  Esc returns to Nav mode; Go cards get syntax highlighting via `go/scanner`.
  Edits are in-memory only (an `edited` unsaved-marker shows in Nav mode);
  Save lands in M4.
- `cmd/9ed`: Save (Ctrl+S) — atomic whole-file write (temp file + rename,
  original permissions preserved), reassembling cards in order; no
  incremental per-card writes. A failed save surfaces in the status line
  instead of crashing. Reassembly inserts a newline between cards when an
  edit strips one, so a card's edit can never silently glue onto the next
  card's first line (bug caught interactively, now a regression test).
- `cmd/9ed`: 9P server surface (M5) — every running buffer serves
  `/tag` and `/cards/<n>/{title,body,lang}` read-only over a Unix domain
  socket (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/9ed/<pid>.sock`, 0600) plus a discovery file
  naming the edited path, best-effort (a failure to start degrades to no
  9P surface, not a refusal to edit). `bufferView` is the thread-safe
  seam publishing the live deck for the server's own goroutine to read,
  since it runs concurrently with tui's single-threaded event loop —
  verified under `-race`, plus a real end-to-end test dialing the actual
  9P wire protocol (`client.Dial("unix", ...)`) rather than calling the
  filesystem methods directly.
